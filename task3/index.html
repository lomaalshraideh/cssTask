<p class="first p">In the heart of an ancient city, tucked between narrow, cobblestone streets, there lay an old bookstore. Its faded wooden sign read “Mystic Pages,” and the smell of aged paper and ink filled the air. The bookstore was owned by an enigmatic old man named Elias, whose twinkling eyes and soft-spoken nature drew customers in like a moth to a flame.</p>

<p class="box-shadow">Perched on the edge of the old wooden dock, Sara let her feet dangle over the sparkling water. The gentle ripples seemed to dance under the golden hue of the setting sun, casting shimmering reflections that played tricks with her eyes. The cool breeze carried the faint scent of wildflowers from the nearby meadow, mixing with the salty aroma of the sea.</p>

        In the hush of midnight's grace, The stars align, in silent space. Whispers of dreams begin to dance, Under the moon's enchanting trance.
        
        Shadows stretch and yawn so deep, Guarding secrets, memories to keep. A tranquil world in slumber lies, Underneath the velvet skies.
